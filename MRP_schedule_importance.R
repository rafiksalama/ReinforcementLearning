#Optimise Schedule

#Schedule optimisation is a process of identifying the best schedule based on the importance of 
#comfort identified for every hour in every room. So every hour, we identiy the comfort and the importance of 
#comfort as the reward of adding comfort in this hour in this room, then we move to the next one. 
#We choose a schedule with less overall cost budget versus the defined budget.

#Importance of comfort is elicited at every hour versus the overall budget as the state that I have no control on
#which is in the mind of the user.

#The reward of this status is that the importance is defined by the amount of feedbacks that I put for every hour
#in every room, plus being scheduled, and the cost. 

#To have more reward, the policy would be to take an action of modifying the importance to match the importance
#of the hour.

#Occupancy, and feedback is a model of the importance 
costTarget = 150

#Markov Chain Monte Carlo, randomly move the room/hour to a discounted state by their probability, or let them stay as they are
#sample a random number for a uniform distribution, and if your probability is smaller than this number, then discount your
#probability of importance by some value
